PASSNUMBER AND IMAGE BASED METHOD AND COMPUTER PROGRAM PRODUCT TO AUTHENTICATE USER IDENTITY

**NOTE: PROCEED WITH CAUTION**

An authentication process is disclosed which uses categories of icons
to create an easy to remember passnumber for use with an electronic platform.
The process may assign each icon a discrete value during registration.
A hash value is created based on combining the discrete values for each icon in the passnumber. 
During a login process, the user is presented with the icons, sometimes in a randomly shuffled.
The user may input the icons that make up his or her passnumber. 
The process may access stored values for user selected icons in the login passnumber entry field
and calculate a login hash value. The process may then determine whether the login hash value matches
the registration hash value to permit or deny login access to the electronic platform.

I would like to introduce you, this solution to raise up the security level of logging step for users to their accounts, authenticating identies.

Did you ever lost your account due to a weak password? Or because of someone who captured your password entries? Are you suffering of forgetting your password every time because of the requirements of the password strength? 
I have invented passnumber, a 100% working method that will enhance the authentication process to authenticate users, I claim that this method is a revolutionary one, that will assist people to keep their accounts safe and secured.
I decided to put this invention on the internet for free as an open source project under GPL3 license to benefit the humanity in the first place, and you may find out our project published for testing purposes at our official website www.passnumber.com  or at the most famous Open Source applications hosts, github and sourceforge.
You may find all the technical details in the description bellow.

Passnumber method can be used whenever that there is a requirement for an authenticating step (users’ login step):
-Operating systems.
-Smart phones applications.
-Banks ATM machines.
-Online and offline networks.
-CMS and websites.
-Electronic locks for any kind of doors and gates.

This is Passnumber, the interactive method to authenticate users' login.

User’s login attempts need a reliable authentication method, the classical method for user’s login "password method" in need to be more secured and easier to be memorized and used.  Password method is requiring from users to select a complex form of letters, numbers and special characters, moreover, this form has to exceed a certain number of length!
There are other types of authentication methods in need for additional devices to maintain the best security level of user’s login attempts, these devices are costly.

Passnumber method is introducing a simple form of numbers only, those can be selected easily from a table of symbols to be displayed in front of the user at the registration step, and these symbols, representing the saved symbols’ values, those have been selected by user once he created the account along with his desired username, hence, this method is simplest and easiest to use.

# Passnumber Authentication System

A secure, grid-based authentication system that combines visual pattern recognition with numeric sequences while maintaining high security through dynamic randomization.

## Overview

The Passnumber technique is an innovative authentication system that uses a grid-based interface where:
- Users select specific icons from a grid to create their pass-number
- Each icon has a unique numeric value
- Grid layout is randomized for every login attempt
- Users can start from any row/icon but must complete a full cycle
- System validates based on the sequence of selected icons

## Key Features

### 1. Dynamic Grid Layout
- Horizontal randomization of icon positions within rows
- Vertical randomization of row categories
- Unique grid layout for every login attempt

### 2. Flexible User Input
- Start from any row or icon
- Complete cycle requirement (traverse all rows once)
- Limited number of neglected rows (zeros)

### 3. Sequence-Based Validation
- Validates sequence of selected icons
- Prevents accidental matches from cyclic permutations
- Secure hash-based storage and comparison

## Security Analysis

### Complexity Metrics
For a 9x9 grid:
- Total possible combinations: 131,681,894,400 (9! × 9!)
- Row order permutations: 362,880 (9!)
- Icon selection permutations: 362,880 (9!)

### Resistance to Common Cyber Attacks

#### High Resistance
- **Brute Force Attacks**: Grid randomization creates vast possibility space
- **Rainbow Table Attacks**: Dynamic sequences prevent precomputed hash tables

- **Browser Inspection**: No plaintext password transmission

#### Moderate Resistance
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**: Encrypted hash transmission
- **Phishing Attacks**: Dynamic grid layout difficult to replicate
- **Social Engineering**: Complex visual pattern hard to describe
- **Replay Attacks**: Session-based randomization prevents reuse
